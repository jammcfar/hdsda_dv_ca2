#+TITLE: Poverty dash

* TODO
1) Repair the join between map data and pov data
2) Reduce down map data size
3) Impute gini, median, gdp_capita, life_exp and pop
4) Summarise all subregions (get the median) (if this is a thing, probably is)

* Dataset
- An attempt to normalise global absolute poverty across different economies
- Well researched and referenced
